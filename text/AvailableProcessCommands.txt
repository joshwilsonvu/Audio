        Highshelf (double frequency) (double Q) (double gain)

    Compress (double threshold) (double ratio) (double attackTime)
             (double releaseTime) {double postgain}

    Process

Usage:
    Enter the function names followed by their parameters, seperating them with single spaces.
    Parentheses () indicate required parameters while brackets {} indicate optional parameters.
    Times are in (ms), gains are in (dB), and a value of ratio less than 1 will define a limiter.
    When ready, use "Process".
